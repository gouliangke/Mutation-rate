# Mutation-rate


##### The genotype folder contains the genotype for 1040 segreants, as well as the genotype for the 843 segregants used for QTL mapping.
##### The mutation_spectrum contains the codes for MiSeq data processing, mutation variants calling, mutation spectrum detection and plotting.  
##### The phenotype folder contains the mutations per culture (parameter m) for 843 segreants, as well as the number of cells per culture (parameter N) for the corresponding segregants.
##### The qtl_mapping folder contains the codes for QTL mapping and the codes to plot the correlation between mutation rate and mutagen resistance.
